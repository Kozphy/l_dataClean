# Exploring 1d data

The simplest case is when you have a one-dimensional dataset, which is just a **collection of numbers**.

## first step

An obvious first step is to compute a few summary statistics. You’d like to know how many data points you have, the **smallest, the largest, the mean, and the standard deviation**.

## next step

But even these don’t necessarily give you a great understanding. A good next step is to create a **histogram**, in which **you group your data into discrete buckets and count how many points fall into each bucket**.
