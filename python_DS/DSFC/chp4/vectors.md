# Vectors

Abstractly, vectors are objects that **can be added together to form new vectors** and that can be multiplied by **scalars** (i.e., numbers), also to form new vectors.

Concretely (for us), vectors are points in some `finite-dimensional space`.

for ex, if you have the heights, weights, and ages of a large number of people, you can treat your data as **three-dimensional vectors [height, weight, age]**.
