# site - Site-specific configuration hook¶

## [Source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site)

**This module is automatically imported during initialization**. The automatic import can be suppressed using the interpreter’s `-S` option.

Importing this module will append `site-specific paths` to the module search path and add a few builtins, unless `-S` was used.
